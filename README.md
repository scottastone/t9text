# T9 Text Converter

This tool converts regular text into the sequence of key presses required to type it on a T9 predictive keyboard.

## How it Works

T9 (Text on 9 keys) was a predictive text technology used on mobile phones with a 3x4 numeric keypad. Each number key represented multiple letters (e.g., '2' for A, B, C). To type a word, you would press each key once, and the T9 software would predict the intended word.

This converter takes your input text and outputs the corresponding sequence of T9 key presses.

## Example

Input: `hello`
Output: `43556`
